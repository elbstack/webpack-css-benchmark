# webpack-css-benchmark

There are many CSS-in-JS solutions, but they all came with a perfomance impact. Some of them have perfomance-issues on browser (f.e. [emotion](https://emotion.sh)) other lost performance on webpack-buildtime (f.e. [linaria](https://linaria.now.sh) or css-modules). 

This is a small benchmark to test perfomance on webpack-build-time. All results can be find [here](benchmark.md);

## run your own benchmark
